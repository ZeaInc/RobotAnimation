# Zea Robot Animation Showcase
The robot animation showcase demonstrates the power of combining plugins with the Zea Engine. In this example, you can animate a CAD model, rendered inside a LIDAR point cloud environment, using inverse kinematics.

The Zea Point Clouds plugin is based on the impressive [Potree](https://github.com/potree/potree/) rendering solution that was originally implemented in ThreeJS.

Visit the [Zea showcase page](https://blog.zea.live/en/showcase/robot-animation) for more information.

## Features
- Animate the robot using inverse kinematics
- Add, remove and edit keyframes
- Undo and redo your changes
- Show and hide items in the scene, e.g. the environment
- View the project in VR using a HTC Vive or Oculus Rift headset (coming soon)
